# Findings & Decisions

## Requirements
- WebDAV-restored projects must survive a machine change without blindly trusting stale absolute paths.
- Project rebinding should verify both repository identity and revision consistency.
- Operators need explicit UI states for path problems, wrong-repo problems, and commit drift.
- Existing SQLite databases must gain the new fields without forcing a rebuild.

## Research Findings
- `Project` previously stored only `repo_path`, so a restored DB could not tell whether a new local path pointed to the same repository.
- The app already has a small startup migration hook in `dsl.app`, so adding nullable `Project` columns is feasible without Alembic.
- WebDAV upload happens from the local DB file directly, which makes it the correct place to refresh project fingerprints before syncing.
- The earlier relink flow only repaired paths; it had no way to reject a different remote or highlight a same-remote commit drift.
- Existing project tests used fake `.git` directories, which are insufficient once fingerprint logic depends on real Git metadata.
- A zero-byte `data/dsl.db` means SQLite created the file on first connect, but the schema bootstrap path never ran before request handling.
- `Base.metadata` already contains `projects` and `email_settings`, so the production failure is not missing model imports inside the codebase; it is missing or bypassed initialization timing.
- Multiple services instantiate `SessionLocal()` directly, so fixing only FastAPI `lifespan` would leave the database bootstrap path fragile.

## Technical Decisions
| Decision | Rationale |
|----------|-----------|
| Persist normalized `repo_remote_url` and `repo_head_commit_hash` on `Project` | This is the minimum durable fingerprint needed to compare restored projects across machines |
| Normalize remote URLs before storing/comparing | Lets `git@host:org/repo.git` and `https://host/org/repo.git` compare as the same repository |
| Refresh fingerprints before WebDAV upload | Keeps the synced database aligned with the latest accepted local repo state |
| Reject relink when remote mismatches, but allow commit drift with a warning | Wrong repo is unsafe; newer commit on the same repo can be intentional |
| Backfill only missing fingerprints on startup | Avoids destroying the previously synced baseline while still upgrading old databases |
| Replace fake-repo tests with real Git repos | Needed to validate remote normalization, HEAD drift, and refresh behavior accurately |
| Centralize schema initialization in `utils.database` and reuse it from both startup and session creation | Prevents empty or partially initialized SQLite databases from reaching request handlers |

## 2026-03-18 Complete Flow Findings
- `dsl/services/codex_runner.py` currently models `Complete` as a Codex prompt that only covers `commit` then `git rebase main`; there is no real `checkout main`, `merge`, or worktree cleanup.
- `dsl/api/tasks.py` already routes worktree-backed completion through `run_codex_completion`, so the backend has a single place to replace prompt-driven Git finalization with deterministic commands.
- `dsl/services/task_service.py` computes task branches as `task/<task_id[:8]>` and worktree paths as `<repo>-wt-<task_short_id>`, but its external script detection only covers `new-worktree.sh` / `create-worktree.sh`.
- `~/code/zata_code_template/scripts/git_worktree.sh` is the reference create script; `git_worktree_merge.sh` provides cleanup logic and a delete-only mode that is useful after a separate local merge.
- The template merge script pushes by default, so Koda should not call it for the merge itself; it should only reuse the cleanup pattern after the local merge succeeds.
- In a multi-worktree repo, `main` may already be checked out elsewhere, so assuming Koda can always `git checkout main` in an arbitrary worktree is unsafe.
- The user explicitly requires automatic conflict handling during `git rebase main`, which makes Codex a targeted conflict-repair tool rather than the primary executor of the whole completion flow.
- The commit subject should come from the task summary / requirement brief rather than the raw task title.

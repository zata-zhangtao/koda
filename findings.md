# Findings & Decisions

## Requirements
- WebDAV-restored projects must survive a machine change without blindly trusting stale absolute paths.
- Project rebinding should verify both repository identity and revision consistency.
- Operators need explicit UI states for path problems, wrong-repo problems, and commit drift.
- Existing SQLite databases must gain the new fields without forcing a rebuild.

## Research Findings
- `Project` previously stored only `repo_path`, so a restored DB could not tell whether a new local path pointed to the same repository.
- The app already has a small startup migration hook in `dsl.app`, so adding nullable `Project` columns is feasible without Alembic.
- WebDAV upload happens from the local DB file directly, which makes it the correct place to refresh project fingerprints before syncing.
- The earlier relink flow only repaired paths; it had no way to reject a different remote or highlight a same-remote commit drift.
- Existing project tests used fake `.git` directories, which are insufficient once fingerprint logic depends on real Git metadata.

## Technical Decisions
| Decision | Rationale |
|----------|-----------|
| Persist normalized `repo_remote_url` and `repo_head_commit_hash` on `Project` | This is the minimum durable fingerprint needed to compare restored projects across machines |
| Normalize remote URLs before storing/comparing | Lets `git@host:org/repo.git` and `https://host/org/repo.git` compare as the same repository |
| Refresh fingerprints before WebDAV upload | Keeps the synced database aligned with the latest accepted local repo state |
| Reject relink when remote mismatches, but allow commit drift with a warning | Wrong repo is unsafe; newer commit on the same repo can be intentional |
| Backfill only missing fingerprints on startup | Avoids destroying the previously synced baseline while still upgrading old databases |
| Replace fake-repo tests with real Git repos | Needed to validate remote normalization, HEAD drift, and refresh behavior accurately |
